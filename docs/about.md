# About Us  #
Actually, there's no "us;" there's just me. I wrote the original Verbtrainer when I was trying to learn Spanish and needed something to drill myself over and over (and over and over and over and...) on the many verb forms. That first version was for a PC and I did, indeed, drill myself over and over. It worked! I don't claim to be fluent in Spanish, but I sure do know the verb forms necessary to speak the language.
