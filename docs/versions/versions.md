# Versions of Verbtrainers #
We offer Verbtrainers for four languages: **Spanish (Verbos)**, **French (Verbes)**, **Italian (Verbi)** and **German (Verben)**. They all work the same, with just a few small differences to account for differences in the languages. (For example, all except German have Simple Tenses and Compound Tenses; German does not, so Verben verb criteria screen looks a little bit different - no compound tenses.)
