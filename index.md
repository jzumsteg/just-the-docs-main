# Verbtrainers #
If you're trying to learn Spanish, you know there are 89 different forms of *every* verb in the language. French has xx, Italian yy and German zz. You do not need to learn evey form of every verb, as each language has some tenses thare are used rarely in day-to-day spoken conversation. But still, gto have basic proficiency, you need to know five or so tenses, each with six to eight forms. Not an easy task!
